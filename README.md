# Surfs_up

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to use the SQLite to determine if the surf shop can remain in buisness all year round.
Main method of pulling data was through a jupyter notebook using SQLAlchemy and Pandas.  

## Results

The data has been compiled for the months of June and December below.

### *June*

### *December*

- Both months share a similar average of being in the 70째s
- Some days in December went low as 56째s
- The count was close to the same so that meant the temperature doesnt fluctuates too much.


## Summary
After conducting this analysis, I concluded that the shop should be open all year.Even though some days were as low as 56째, I made
a couple of histogram charts that show that those days are pretty rare compared to the average of the 70째 that normally happens.
